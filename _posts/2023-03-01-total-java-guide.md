## What & Why Java
   - Platform independence: Java is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that once a program is written, it can be run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.
   - Robustness: Java is designed to be a robust and reliable programming language, with features such as memory management and exception handling built in.
   - Object-oriented programming: Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it provides a natural and flexible way to model real-world objects and their relationships.
   - Large community: Java has a large and active community of developers, which means that there are many resources available for learning, support, and collaboration.
   - Performance: While Java may not be the fastest language out there, it is highly optimized for performance and can handle complex tasks efficiently.
   - Security: Java provides a secure runtime environment with features such as automatic memory management, byte-code verification, and sandboxing.
   - Versatility: Java can be used for a wide range of applications, from desktop and mobile applications to web and enterprise applications.
   - Scalability: Java's architecture is designed to be scalable, meaning that it can handle large and complex applications with ease.
   - Popular frameworks: Java has many popular and powerful frameworks, such as Spring, Hibernate, and Struts, which can make development faster and easier.
   - Support for multiple paradigms: Java supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming, making it flexible and adaptable to different programming styles.

## Getting Started

A variable is a named container that stores a value of a particular data type. In Java, variables are used to hold values that can be manipulated and used throughout a program.

Variables can be of two types in Java: primitive types and reference types.

### Primitive Variables

Primitive variables are used to store simple values like numbers and characters. The following are the primitive data types available in Java:

    byte: 8-bit integer value
    short: 16-bit integer value
    int: 32-bit integer value
    long: 64-bit integer value
    float: 32-bit floating-point value
    double: 64-bit floating-point value
    char: 16-bit Unicode character value
    boolean: true or false value

Primitive variables are declared using a data type keyword, followed by the variable name, and optionally, an initial value. For example, to declare an integer variable named "count" with an initial value of 0, you would write:
```java
int count = 0;
```

### Reference Variables

Reference variables are used to store object references, which point to objects in memory. Reference variables are declared using the class name of the object they reference, followed by the variable name, and optionally, an initial value. For example, to declare a reference variable named "myObject" that refers to an instance of the String class, you would write:
```java
String myObject = new String("Hello, World!");
```
In this example, the new keyword creates a new instance of the String class, and the reference variable myObject points to this new object.

### Variable Scope
The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed in a program. In Java, variables can have different scopes depending on where they are declared. The following are the different types of variable scopes in Java:

    Local scope: Variables declared inside a method or block of code have local scope and can only be accessed within that method or block.
    Instance scope: Variables declared inside a class but outside of any method have instance scope and can be accessed by any method of the class.
    Class scope: Variables declared as static inside a class have class scope and can be accessed by any method of the class.
    
### Variable Naming Conventions
It's important to follow naming conventions when naming variables in Java. Variable names should be descriptive, concise, and follow a standard naming convention. In Java, the standard convention for naming variables is to use camelCase, where the first word is in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized. For example:
```java
int studentCount;
String customerName;
```
By following these conventions, your code will be more readable and easier to understand for other developers who may need to work with your code.
